# Question
What is event delegation?

# Answer
Event delegation is a JavaScript technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to handle events that occur on its children. This eliminates the need for attaching listeners to each child individually, making event handling more efficient, especially for dynamically added or removed elements. 

It uses event propagation, specifically the "bubbling" phase, where an event travels up the DOM hierarchy from the target element to the root. Event delegation is used to efficiently handle events on elements that are dynamic or numerous in quantity. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future.
