# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation is helpful because it simplifies event handling by allowing you to attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple listeners to each child element. This reduces redundancy, improves performance, and makes the code more adaptable to changes in the DOM structure.
